** My personal opinion **
The course was awesome, the focus on modern React and JS is great. I learned more I could ever have learned in college. Maybe some of the content is still not greatly explained (some parts with the reducers) but with practice it comes really easy

I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to get better at programming and at getting better with current technologies
